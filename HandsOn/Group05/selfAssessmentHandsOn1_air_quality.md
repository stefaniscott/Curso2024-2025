# Self-Assessment for Hands-On 1

## Dataset Selection
The selected dataset is the [Air Quality Dataset](https://datos.gob.es/es/catalogo/l01330241-calidad-del-aire-estaciones-moviles-campana-portuarios). This dataset provides valuable information about air quality, which is highly relevant to smart city applications, particularly in monitoring environmental health and pollution levels in urban areas.

### Dataset Requirements Satisfaction
1. **R1 (Smart city domain)**: The dataset focuses on air quality, a critical factor for public health and environmental sustainability in cities.
2. **R2 (CSV format)**: The dataset is available in CSV format, which makes it easy to process and analyze.
3. **R3 (Open license)**: The dataset is licensed under an open license, allowing us to reuse and publish the data without restrictions.
4. **R4 (Linkable to real-world entities)**: The data includes information about air quality stations, which can be linked to geographic locations for real-world analysis.

### Optional Requirements
- **R5 (Documentation)**: The dataset includes detailed documentation, which is helpful for understanding the structure and the meaning of the data, partially fulfilling this requirement.
- **R6 (Multiple data sources)**: The dataset comes from a single government source, so it does not meet the requirement of having multiple data sources.

## Application Design
We plan to build an interactive application that provides real-time insights into air quality across different locations, particularly focusing on port areas. The key features of the application will include:
- A map showing the locations of air quality monitoring stations.
- Real-time data visualizations for air quality metrics such as pollutant levels.
- Filters to allow users to view data for specific pollutants or timeframes (daily, weekly).
- Integration with weather data to provide additional context to the air quality information.

## Self-Evaluation
We believe we have successfully met the core requirements for this assignment:
- We selected a dataset that is relevant to smart city domains and meets all the primary requirements (R1 to R4).
- We designed an application that effectively leverages the data to provide useful insights to users about air quality.
- The optional requirements (R5 and R6) were discussed, and while R5 is partially met, we acknowledge that R6 is not fulfilled as the dataset originates from a single source.

Overall, this hands-on assignment has provided valuable experience in selecting and working with open data, as well as planning the development of an application based on real-world data.
