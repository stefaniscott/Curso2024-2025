    <h2>R1: Data in smart city domain</h2>
        <p>The dataset comes from the
        <a href="https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/374e0a2f-e356-4531-bb8e-bf81552051ec/reported-numbers-of-abandoned-vehicles"><i>datos.gov.uk</i></a>
        website, which collects data from United Kindom.
        </p>

        <h2>R2: Data available as a CSV file</h2>
        <p> The dataset is available as a CSV file <a href="http://data.defra.gov.uk/env/wrtb26b_ab_veh_region_200905.csv">here</a>, and can be located locally at the csv folder of the repository. </p>
            
        <h2>R3: Data have an open license so it can be published</h2>
        <p> The data can be reused for commercial and non-commercial purpose under an <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/">open license.</a> </p>
        
        <h2>R4: Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities</h2>
        <p>The dataset on abandoned vehicles can be easily linked to the real world, as it provides concrete information about an issue that occurs in everyday life.
            Can be connected to specific locations within the UK, allowing for the identification of geographic patterns in vehicle abandonment across different regions or cities.
            This type of dataset has direct implications for criminological studies, as abandoned vehicles can be linked to illegal activities such as theft, vandalism, or even more serious crimes.
