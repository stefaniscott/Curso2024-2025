"To estimate missing data, the supplied data for 2007/08 has been used if at least three quarterly periods have been supplied for 2007/08.  If fewer than three quarterly periods have been supplied for 2007/08 then data from 2006/07 has been used and the average percentage increase/decrease for that region has been applied to the 2006/07 data to estimate the 2007/08 figure.",,,,,,,,,,
This is the estimation method used for previous years' data.,,,,,,,,,,
Ealing's 2007/08 figure is the number of abandoned vehicles of which the authority has disposed.  Previous figures for Ealing are the number of abandoned vehicles reported to the authority. ,,,,,,,,,,
